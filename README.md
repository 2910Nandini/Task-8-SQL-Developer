Task 8: Triggers and Procedures
This task focuses on automating actions using triggers and procedures to improve database
efficiency and maintainability.
�� Section 1: Triggers & Procedures
�� Objective
�� Automate actions using triggers and create procedures for reusable database operations.
�� Tasks to Perform
✅ 1. Triggers
● Automatically log updates in a separate table when student records change.
● Use AFTER UPDATE trigger to capture changes.
✅ 2. Procedures
● Create a stored procedure to update student grades based on their performance.
● Ensure flexibility to handle different grading criteria.
�� Deliverable: Automated logging and reusable grade update logic.
�� Section 2: Explanation of Queries
�� How Triggers Work
✔️ Triggers execute automatically after specific actions (e.g., insert, update, delete).
✔️ Used to log changes in a separate audit table.
�� How Procedures Work
✔️ Stored procedures encapsulate reusable SQL operations.
✔️ Helps in bulk updates like modifying student grades based on conditions.
�� Section 3: Execution & Validation
1️⃣Define Triggers & Procedures
● Write queries to create triggers and procedures.
2️⃣Test with Updates
● Perform updates to check if the trigger logs changes correctly.
● Run the procedure to ensure grades update properly.
3️⃣Validate Results
● Check log tables for trigger execution.
● Verify grades reflect the intended changes.
